# Homepage

## Description

This Project is the source code for my homepage, which can be found at [https://www.amosgross.com](https://www.amosgross.com).
It is built on Angular, which admittedly is likeley to be quite overkill for the current usecase.

## Development

* To use the development server run `ng serve --open`, this will open up a webpage, which will dynamically update as changes are made
* To build the project run `ng build --prod`, the files can then be accessed under `/homepage/dist/homepage-v1/`
* The current deployment is done using Docker, the configuration of which is kept outside of the repo for security purposes

## Further Plans

The Goal of this Project is to provide a presentation of myself.
In order to better achieve this, the following improvements are currently in planning
* Improve the Desktop styling
* Add a bodybuilding section to the main page
* Add a seperate page to showcase my projects outside of Github
