# About

Hello there, again...

As you may have gathered from the quick introduction on my [homepage](/), I'm a software Developer. 

As such, I spend most of my time cruising around in Kubernetes, developing in C, Rust, Java, Go, Typescript, Dart and a bunch of other languages and frameworks. If you're ever interested in how cool I am, be sure to take a look at [all of the configs from](https://github.com/grossamos/.dotfiles).

For everything else, look around my site or checkout my [Github](https://github.com/grossamos) or [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/amos-gro%C3%9F-19a7b2198).
