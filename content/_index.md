Hello there,
 
My name is Amos and I enjoy tinkering with tech, programming and a bunch of other stuff.
 
I'm virtually in love with the [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html) project and spend most of my time either in front of a computer screen or in the gym.
 
This [website]() was originally planned as a place for me to showcase my work and passions, however knowing myself it'll probably just end up as a conglomeration of half baked projects and articles.

So yeah, sit back, enjoy and don't forget to [greet General Kenobi](https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc) on your way in next time.
