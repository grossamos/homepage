Hello there,
 
My name is Amos and I enjoy tinkering with tech, programming and a bunch of other stuff.
Most of my time is either spent in front of a computer screen, at the gym, or slurping on some lentil soup.

I'm a huge fan of [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.en.html) and all things open source.
Currently my distribution of choice is fedora silverblue.

Projects of mine range across writing [fitness apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amosgross.weight_track_app), [operating systems](https://github.com/grossamos/oxos), and smaller tools.

So yeah, sit back, enjoy and don't forget to [greet General Kenobi](https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc) on your way in next time.
